<h5>My most recent experience</h5>

- Delivered numerous Quality of Life (QoL) features for the product, directly improving user workflows and reducing manual support tickets by an estimated 10%.
- Managed and executed features deployments using **KubeDash**, including directly troubleshooting **Kubernetes** issues (listing/removing pods, rerunning jobs) and performing production rollbacks.
- Enhanced CI/CD reliability by authoring a custom **GitHub Action** to enforce SQL formatting using **sqlfluff**, preventing invalid schema migrations.
- Built a cost-saving automation script to re-optimize failed image assets, estimated to reduce monthly internal CDN and storage waste by over 15%
- Monitored and debugged Go and React services in production using **Datadog** for log analysis and **Sentry** for real-time error alerts.
- Developed and deployed critical 3rd-party integrations (including Marketo, Knock App, and custom DAM providers) using API keys and secure authentication flows
